## Description
My personal portfolio for 2023! [My old portfolio](https://kanelariviere-old.vercel.app) was minimal and straightforward. I tried to implement a similar minimal theme for this portfolio, while actually focusing on the design. I wanted this portfolio to show a little more personality, for itself & for me. Sections include work, about, contact, tsif, & guestbook. 

This portfolio features a gallery, titled 'The Sky is Fake' (TSIF), that showcases some of my favorite pictures I've taken of the sky. The pictures are pulled 4 at a time from an array, which includes the url of the picture & the location where the picture was taken. I wanted to include this because it's something that I would hear my brother say often, and the sentiment of 'The Sky is Fake' has become a part of who I am. 

This portfolio also features a guestbook, where visitors can sign in via Apple, Discord, or Google (provided by Clerk), and leave a note or message! Building this feature was a lot of fun because I got to work with [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), which was a **dream** to integrate. I'm excited to see what people will say!
