title: My Journey Into Front End & Full Stack Development
description: How It Started & Where I Am Now

My hope is that this blog documents my journey and serves as a place where I can learn, teach, and inspire. But you should probably know who I am first. I didn't learn to code in the womb. I didn't get into MIT right after high school. I don't have an uncle who works at Meta. I've never hacked into the mainframe. So *why* should you care about what I have to say?

###### Disclaimer: There's some oversimplifications in this post, but hopefully it doesn't detract from the point I'm trying to make! Thanks! 

## How It Started
When I was little, we had this [massive 55" Mitsubishi TV](https://www.recycledgoods.com/mitsubishi-55-widescreen-rear-projection-tv-ws-55809/) that I would **dream** about taking apart. I wanted to witness how it worked, and why it worked. But you can't disassemble the 300 lb. family TV when you're 8 years old. It's just not sensible. We didn't have much, and we certainly didn't have anything to spare a curious kid who was **absolutely** going to break it. So what did I break instead? Well, nothing. 

I'd love to say that I chased that dream & supplemented my curiosity elsewhere. **But I didn't**. **I couldn't**. 

It wasn't until my later years in high school that I found something that I could break. Software. I took a class learning HTML & CSS. I hated it. I just wasn't concerned with semantic HTML and how to make text change colors. So instead of paying attention in class, I learned Python. *Why Python?* It was the first language listed on a google search. 

```python
print('Hello World! Goodbye HTML!')
```

I like to think that I got pretty good with Python, too. But after that semester, I didn't code at all. And I didn't start again until I was in college. 

###### Lesson: If you want to do something, do it. The hardest step to take is the first one. Once that's done, everything else will come together. 

## How It Started, Again
A few years after high school, I was working in sales for an international telecommunications company. Not a bad job, but it just wasn't what I wanted. I decided that it was time for college! I learned a lot in the program that I was in. Java, C#, Python, data structures and algorithms, logic, theory, etc. The coursework was incredible, and it felt great to be learning again. The week before finals, my brother passed very suddenly. Everything stopped. When I asked my professors for extensions on my finals, every single one of them said no. I failed every class that semester and decided I'd take a break before trying again. It was hard not to let that cloud how I felt about college as an institution.  

Someone I hadn't spoken to for some time reached out to me shortly afterwards. I'd looked up to this person for years, initially for their musical talent as I'd grown up playing music, and more recently for their success in tech as the CEO of their own startup. I was lucky enough to pick their brain about what I should do and I got some really solid advice. 

## 

That **free advice from a successful tech CEO** was -

1. **Focus**. Learning everything is fine if you don't want to be good at any of it. You can cast a wide net & try many things, but you'll have to dial it in sooner or later.  

2. **Find your place**. Find what interests you. Find something you can see yourself doing for 8 hours a day.

3. **Do not give up**. You're going to get beaten down, repeatedly, and you have to get back up and do it all over again. 

You're welcome. 

## 

Admittedly, this is all pretty standard advice. But to the ears of a very lost 23-year-old who needed to hear it, it meant **everything**. 

At this point, I was pretty good with Python. But it just didn't excite me anymore. Don't get me wrong, I know the problem is me because Python is absolute magic, but I needed something else. Queue the standoff with HTML. I swallowed every bit of pride I had and relearned the basics. This time around, I loved it. I went on to learn CSS, and JavaScript, and fell deeper and deeper into web development. I could make, break, and fix things, and then *share it with anyone*. 

```js
console.log('Hello World! Goodbye Python!') 
```

Shortly after falling down this rabbit hole, I started college again. I don't think college is absolutely necessary to be successful in this field, but it's something that I wanted to see through. Thankfully, I didn't put college off for *too* long. I just took some small breaks that let me breathe and realign, so a lot of what I learned stayed with me. 

The unfortunate reality is that, without a degree, finding a job is going to be an uphill battle. It's not impossible, but you will have to be  better than everyone else. 

###### Lesson: Find something that excites you and see it through. It might take some trial and error, but once you've found it, you'll know. I spent so long thinking I was too good for HTML, and it's exactly what sent me down the path I'm on now. Maybe go to college, too. 

## The Present
The end of 2023! I've been working full time, finishing up my degree, and freelancing & working on personal projects in any free time that I have left. The road has been anything but smooth, but I've loved every bit of it so far. Between everything that I'm doing, I'm excited to keep going.

###### Lesson: *Do not give up*. No matter what. If you're working full time, if you're in school full time, if you're barely finding time for what you love, just keep pushing. 

## 

Here are some very important lessons I've learned so far - 
  1. **Knowledge has a compounding nature**. Every topic you learn is built on top of the previous topic.
  2. **Build literally anything**. Preferably something that solves a problem.
  3. **Learning is not linear**. You'll excel on some days, and you'll feel behind on others. That's okay.
  4. **Pick a niche**! Whatever you like, do that!
  5. **Network**. Network, network, network.
  6. **It's never too late**. Whether you're switching careers, going back to school, or anything else, there is no schedule or predefined path. 

I'm not a seasoned professional with years of experience in a corporate environment. I'm not a prodigy with groundbreaking ideas that will revolutionize the industry. You don't have to be either. I'm just someone that rediscovered their dream of breaking things and putting them back together. It just so happens that the things I break are also the things I've built. And I believe that is equally as exciting.
