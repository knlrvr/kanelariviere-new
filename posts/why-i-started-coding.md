title: Why I Started Coding
description: My journey into software development

My hope is that this blog documents my journey and serves as a place where I can learn, teach, and inspire. But you should probably know who I am first. I didn't learn to code in the womb. I didn't get into MIT right after high school. I don't have an uncle who works at Meta. I've never hacked into the mainframe. So *why* should you care about what I have to say?

## How It Started
When I was little, we had [this massive 55" Mitsubishi TV](https://www.recycledgoods.com/mitsubishi-55-widescreen-rear-projection-tv-ws-55809/) that I would **dream** about taking apart. I wanted to witness how it worked, and *why* it worked. But you can't disassemble the 300 lb. (136 kg) family TV when you're 8 years old. It's just not sensible. We didn't have much, and we certainly didn't have anything to spare a curious kid who was **absolutely** going to break it. So what did I break instead? Well, nothing. 

I'd love to say that I chased that dream & supplemented my curiosity elsewhere. **But I didn't**. **I couldn't**. 

It wasn't until my later years in high school that I found something that I could break. **Software**. I took a class learning HTML & CSS, but to be honest, I hated it. I just wasn't concerned with semantic HTML and how to make text change colors or move around the page, which is strange since I've always been a very visual person &mdash; in learning, in art, in self-expression, etc. Maybe it had to do with how coding is portrayed in mainstream media, but I dreamt of racing against the clock to hack into places I shouldn't be in, even if that wasn't actually what I wanted. So instead of paying attention in class, I learned Python. 

*Why Python?* It was the first language listed on a google search for 'hacking'.

```python
print('Hello World! Goodbye HTML!')
```

I like to think that I got pretty good with Python, too. But after that semester, I didn't code at all. I just didn't have the resources to. And I wouldn't start again until I was in college. 

## How It Started, Again
A few years after high school, I was working in sales for an 'international telecommunications company', which I very intentionally make sound cooler than it was. I was the person you'd talk to when you wanted to get a new phone from your mobile carrier. Not a bad job &mdash; it just wasn't what I wanted. I wasn't even sure what I wanted at that point. I decided that it was time for college! I enrolled in a two year program for Applications Development and I learned **a lot**. Java, C#, Python, data structures and algorithms, logic, theory, etc. The coursework was incredible, and it felt great to be learning again. I was coding & learning something new every single day, and I rediscovered that same passion I'd had for it in high school. This time, I had the resources to keep going. 

## Things Change Rapidly & There's Nothing You Can Do About It
The week before finals in my second semester, my brother passed very suddenly. Everything stopped. When I asked my professors for extensions on my finals, every single one of them said no. I failed every class that semester and decided I'd take a break before trying again. It was hard not to let that cloud how I felt about college as an institution. 

I was lost. My world had turned upside down, and I had no idea how to navigate it. At this point, I had learned only a little about so many different things through school & self-learning &mdash; Networking, Cybersecurity, Data, Web Development, etc. I was disillusioned with college and trying to learn anything I could for the real world (don't do this). 

Someone I hadn't spoken to for some time reached out to me around when I would've been (or should've been) starting my second year of college. I'd looked up to this person for years, from when I was 13 and hearing them play music, to this point at 23, watching them grow their startup. I was lucky enough to pick their brain about what I should do and I got some really solid advice. 

## 

That **free advice from a successful tech CEO** was -

**Focus**. Learning everything is fine if you don't want to be good at any of it. You can cast a wide net & try many things, but you'll have to dial it in and find what excites you. 

**Find your place**. Find what excites you. Find what interests you. Find something you can see yourself doing for at least 8 hours a day.

**Do not give up**. You're going to get beaten down, repeatedly, and you have to get back up and do it all over again. And again. And again. 

**Go to college**. You obviously don't *have* to, but if you don't, you need to make sure that you're better than anyone who did. 

###### You're welcome. 

##

Admittedly, this is all pretty standard advice when entering tech. But to a very lost 23-year-old who needed to hear it, it meant **everything**. It wasn't advice from a successful professional, it was advice from a *friend*. 

## I'm Not A Hacker

At this point, I was pretty good with Python. But it didn't *excite* me anymore. Don't get me wrong, I know the problem is me because Python is absolute magic, but I needed something else. I only chose it because I thought I wanted to be a hacker (ethical, of course), and I'd learned that I was wrong. 

**Cue the standoff with HTML**. 

I swallowed every bit of pride I had and revisited the basics. This time around, I loved it. I went on to learn JavaScript, and fell deeper and deeper into web development. I could make, break, and fix things, and then **share it with anyone**. 

```js
console.log('Hello World! Goodbye (for now) Python!') 
```

##

Not very long after falling down this rabbit hole, I started college again. Thankfully, I hadn't put college off for *too* long. I just took some small breaks that let me breathe and realign, so a lot of what I learned stayed with me and allowed me to continue building from what I already knew. I still have some strong feelings about college, but that's a blog post for another day. 

## The Present
As I'm writing this, it is 8:43 pm, January 1, 2024. I work full-time in banking, I'm finishing up my degree at WGU (& searching for internships), freelancing and working on anything that I can in any spare time that I have. The road has been anything but smooth but I'm thankful for it and excited to continue learning, sharing, and exploring new opportunities in software. 

##

Here are some really important things that the past few years have taught me &mdash;

**Knowledge has a compounding nature**. Every topic you learn is built on top of the previous topic.  

**Build literally anything**. Preferably something that solves a problem for you. Not for someone else &mdash; **for you**.

**Learning is not linear**. You'll excel on some days, and you'll feel behind on others. That's okay. Just keep pushing. 

**Pick a niche**! Whatever you like, do that! Whether it's front end development, or gaming, or cybersecurity, or whatever else in this vast sea of possibilities. 

**Network**. Network, network, network. The best opportunities will come from people you know. 

**It's never too late**. Whether you're switching careers, going back to school, or anything else, there is no schedule or predefined path. Just do it. 


## Conclusion
I'm not a seasoned professional with years of experience in a corporate environment. I'm not a prodigy with groundbreaking ideas that will revolutionize the industry. You don't have to be, either. I'm just someone that rediscovered their dream of breaking things and putting them back together. It just so happens that the things I break are also the things I've built. And I believe that is equally as exciting.
